# Let your favorite music wake you up in the morning ‚è∞

## How it works
1. Download the applescript
2. Open up your Terminal and type in `crontab -e` and set your prefer alarm time. For more detail `crontab` documentation, check http://www.adminschoice.com/crontab-quick-reference
3. Go to System Preference and energy saver to set your Mac automated start up time.
4. Make sure your Mac start up before your scheduled time.

I made few changes to make it adapt my system.
